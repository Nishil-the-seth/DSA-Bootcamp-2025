# Matrix Chain Multiplication

Given the dimension of a sequence of matrices in an array arr[], where the dimension of the ith matrix is (arr[i-1] * arr[i]), the task is to find the most efficient way to multiply these matrices together such that the total number of element multiplications is minimum. When two matrices of size m*n and n*p when multiplied, they generate a matrix of size m*p and the number of multiplications performed is m*n*p.
