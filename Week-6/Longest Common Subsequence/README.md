# Longest Common Subsequence

Given two strings, s1 and s2, the task is to find the length of the Longest Common Subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0. A subsequence is a string generated from the original string by deleting 0 or more characters, without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

For example, subsequences of "ABC" are "", "A", "B", "C", "AB", "AC", "BC" and "ABC". In general, a string of length n has 2n subsequences.
