# Trees

## What is a Tree?
A tree in DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a way to organize data. It looks like an upside-down tree with a root at the top and branches spreading out. Each point on the tree is called a node, and the lines connecting them are called edges. The top node is the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves.

The basic idea of a tree is to show a hierarchy.

For example, a family tree shows how family members are related. Trees help us organize and find data quickly. They are important because they make searching, sorting, and organizing data more efficient. 

Tree data structures are used in many applications like databases, file systems, and even in games to make decisions. Understanding trees helps us solve problems faster and manage data better.
